find_max_and_min.py
    Finding the largest and smallest numbers without using buit-in functions.
    You’re handling the logic to determine the largest and smallest values without using the max() and min() functions. Instead, you’re using comparison operations in the loop.
    handling edge cases by using float('-inf') and float('inf') to initialize the largest and smallest values, ensuring your logic works for any input, even if the list contains negative values.
